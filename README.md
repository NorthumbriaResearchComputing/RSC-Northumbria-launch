# ✨ Northumbria Research Computing Community Launch event ✨

## ❓What is it?

This is your chance to meet other researchers from across Northumbria University who use and develop research software. Many of us use similar tools, face similar problems, and teach similar topics - even if from different research domains. We hope that by meeting and sharing our experiences, our tips and tricks, our trials and tribulations, we will support and grow the research software community at Northumbria.

A draft timetable for the event is below. Lunch will be provided.

This event has been financially supported by the [Software Sustainability Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk/).

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Who is it for? 

This event is open to staff and postgraduate students across all the departments at Northumbria. You do not need a certain level of expertise to join us - you may have been coding in Fortran since the 70s, or you may be brand new to research computing - you are welcome! 

## 📢 Can I contribute? 

Yes! We are organising 3 minute flash presentations and we would like to have contributions from across the university and career stages. Perhaps you have written a piece of code you would like to show off? Perhaps you have been teaching programming and have some resources to share? Perhaps you have a wild idea and would like an audience to pass it by? You can provide a talk title during the sign-up process.
